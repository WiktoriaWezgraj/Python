'''(p1.py) The playing cards have the following values: Ace (A), King (K), Queen (Q), Jack (J) and 10 (T) have a value of 10 each. The other cards have the value indicated by the card number. Define a function f(player1,player2) that returns true if the first player has cards of the same or higher value, and false otherwise. Example: 

f("AJ972","AQT72") Ã  False 
f("9532","K8") Ã  True '''
