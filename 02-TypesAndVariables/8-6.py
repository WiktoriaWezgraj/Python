6. The binary numeral system is a positional numeral system that requires only two digits to write numbers: 0 and 1. 
The hexadecimal numeral system is a positional numeral system that uses sixteen distinct symbols, most often the 
symbols "0" to "9" to represent values 0 to 9, and "A" to "F" (or alternatively "a" to "f") to represent values from ten to fifteen. 
Both are widely used in mathematics, computer science and digital electronics. Write a program that reads an integer number from the keyboard 
and prints that value as a binary and hexadecimal number. To convert a decimal number to binary or hexadecimal value, use the available Python functions. Sample result:

    Enter number: 125
    Binary number: 0b1111101
    Hexadecimal number: 0x7d'''

num = int(input('Enter a number: '))
print('Binary: ', bin(num), "Hexadecimal: ", hex(num))
