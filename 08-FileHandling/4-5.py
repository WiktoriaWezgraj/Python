'''The file email.txt contains a raw email. Write a program that uses regular expressions to fetch and print:

sender email address
recipient email address
email subject
email body
For each of the above commands, define a separate function (see below) that returns the value read from the email. Place the functions in a separate module called emails.

email_sender()
email_recipient()
email_subject()
email_body()'''
