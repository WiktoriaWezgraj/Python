'''The following program code lists the steps to perform to calculate the area and circumference of a circle. Complete the program. Then, check the program for the following data:

    r = 1 --> circumference = 6.28, area = 3.14
    r = 3 --> circumference = 18.84, area = 28.26'''
    
    ###
    # Calculation of circle area and circumference 
    #

    # determine radius and PI values
    # calculate area 
    # calculate circumference 
    # print results

r = float(input('Enter r value:'))
PI = 3.14
area = r * PI
circumference = r *2 * PI
print(area,circumference)
