'''Many applications require that you create an account with a username and password to use them. 
Often, applications specify requirements for the username and password. Write a program that checks whether a username and password entered from the keyboard meet the requirements below. Use regular expressions.

username is at least 6 characters long
username contains only lowercase letters
password is at least 8 characters long
password contains only letters (lowercase and uppercase), numbers, and the underscore character'''
###
# Checks the correctness of username and password
#
import re

# read username and password from keyboard
username = input('Enter username: ')
password = input('Enter password: ')

# pattern (criteria) for username and password
username_pattern = '^[a-z]{6,}$'
password_pattern = '^[A-Za-z0-9_]{8,}$'

# check if username and password are ok
username_match = re.match(username_pattern,username)
password_match = re.match(password_pattern, password)
print(password_match)
# print results
if username_match and password_match:
   print('You logged in!')
else:
   print("You didn't log in!")
