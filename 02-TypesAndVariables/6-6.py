'''6. In computer science, every written (graphic) character of human language (letters, digits, symbols, etc.) is encoded by assigning it a number. 
This allows characters to be stored, transmitted, and transformed using digital computers. To convert a character to its numerical representation, use the Python ord() function. 

    Write a program to print numerical representations of the following characters:

    a, b, z, A, B, Z, 1, =, +, â‚¬'''

    ###
    # A program to print numerical representations of characters.
    #

x = '+'
print(f'+ {ord(x)}')
