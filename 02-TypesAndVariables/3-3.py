3. Two variables x and y have values of 7 and 34. Write a program that swaps variable values (x should be 34 and y should be 7). Use an additional, auxiliary variable.

    > Hint: It is a good idea to always put a short description of the program in a comment at the beginning of the file. You can use the task text for this.

    > Hint: The program file name may contain the section number and task number, e.g. 3-7.py.
