'''A tuple in Python is an immutable, ordered collection of elements. Tuples are similar to lists, but unlike lists, once a tuple is created, 
its elements cannot be modified, added, or removed.

Write a program that creates a tuple containing a single word ‘computation’. Save a tuple in a variable. Then, print the type of the variable.'''

tup = ('computation',)
print(type(tup))
